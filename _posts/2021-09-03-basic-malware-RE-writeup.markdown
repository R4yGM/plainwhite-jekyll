Basic malware reverse engineering TryHackMe room writeup


# Task 2 Strings :: Challenge 1 

The first thing i did was opening the .exe file with ghidra

After ghidra fully opened, I went on the functions and decompiled the entry function which was interesting, and then i got this

```c
void entry(void)

{
  char *lpText;
  
  lpText = md5_hash(PTR_s_FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIO_00432294);
  MessageBoxA((HWND)0x0,lpText,"We\'ve been compromised!",0x30);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  ExitProcess(0);
}
```

Looking at the C code, we can see that the lpText variable stores the output of the function md5_hash() with a string as parameter

so this is pretty easy basically the program converts the string into an md5 hash

to get the flag you just have to double click the string paramenter on the md5_hash() function.
