But first of all what is TryHackMe? well, [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) is a platform that delivers cyber-security training through gamified real-world labs.
don’t concern yourself if you’re a complete beginer on the field or you think that this stuff is too much hard for you because TryHackMe has you covered, it has a ton of **walktroughts** and **challanges** that make you struggle and learn, and they even teach you a wide variety of things, it has over **193** rooms where most of them are completely free!

**Now what is the Pre-Security path?**
======================================

As i said before THM has  walktroughts and challanges but it also have **Paths** that are basically a pack of walktroughts with a similiar topic.

The [**Pre-Security**](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity) is a path that teaches you the foundamentals to get started on cyber security, that gives you the technical knowledge to learn more difficult topics.

this path contains 4 main topics that i’m going to discuss later which are :

*   **Network Fundamentals**
*   **How The Web Works**
*   **Linux Fundamentals**
*   **Windows Fundamentals**

and also a short room that simply explains the basics and concepts of cyber security.

Review
======

In my opinion, [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) is a great way to get started and expand your knowledge on cybersecurity, i personally just found out about this platform nearly a year ago and then i got seriously interested, i begun spending most of the days doing walktrought and challanges which was very fun, i’ld say this platform is great because it let’s you learn in a gamified way wich is more enjoyable than studying

I found this Pre-Security path interesting to fulfill some holes or features that i forgot, but in my opinion to be honest this path is perfect and complete for a beginner, it nearly covers all of the fundamentals necessary to get better on the field, i would recommend it to a friend or anyone that started getting into the field

Conclusion
==========

And yeah that is Pre-Security path, I hope you enjoyed this blog post and found it useful.
